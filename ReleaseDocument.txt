28 August 2017
0.0.1
The major version of 0 signifies a pre release state. The software is not ready for any end user to work with. 
I need to put stuff up to test how it works with the wider internet so that is why the site is here.

The Diamond Edge Angular 2 front end is up with a Home page with the basic outline of the project.
A company page the consumes the webapi although the api is not working with the Angular site because of cors header on the 
API.

The webapi that will return the in memory companies list
https:/diamondedge.co.uk/api/companies

Individual companies can be return with     
https:/diamondedge.co.uk/api/companies/{companyId}

insert a new company
Send a post to 
https:/diamondedge.co.uk/api/companies
with {"Company":"some text"} 
set the content type header JSON(application/json)
this is pre production so all new id will be 3


Update

Not implemented at this time

Delete a company 
send a Delete http request 
https:/diamondedge.co.uk/api/companies/{companyId}

Both services are behind SSL certificates and the webapi is served via a reverse proxy server.

The site has both a login page and a create new user pages. Both are not working here as 
work on IdentitiyServer4 is on going.
